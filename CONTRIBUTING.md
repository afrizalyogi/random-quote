## Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/afrizalyogi/random-quote/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/afrizalyogi/random-quote/issues/new) it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
